/*
Creat Scala program (HandleErrors.scala) that asks user to type an integer. 
Create a method called readInteger that uses scala.io.readInt method to 
read user input. Use Try to catch errors when reading the user input. 
Call the readInteger method and use match expression to check the 
return value. If the return value is an instance of Success,
print 'You typed {typed_number}'. In the case of Failure, 
print 'That wasn't integer'.

Example output:
Type an integer
8
You typed 8
